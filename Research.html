<h2> Root traits & Plant soil feedbacks </h2>
            
<p>Plant-soil feedbacks have been recognised as playing a key role in a range of ecological processes, including succession, invasion, species coexistence and population dynamics. However, there is substantial variation between species in the strength of plant-soil feedbacks and predicting this variation remains challenging. Here, we propose an original concept to predict the outcome of plant-soil feedbacks. We hypothesize that plants with different combinations of root traits culture different proportions of pathogens and mutualists in their soils and that this contributes to differences in performance between home soils (cultured by conspecifics) versus away soils (cultured by heterospecifics). We use the recently described root economics space, which identifies two gradients in root traits. A conservation gradient distinguishes fast vs. slow species, and from growth defence theory we predict that these species culture different amounts of pathogens in their soils. A collaboration gradient distinguishes species that associate with mycorrhizae to outsource soil nutrient acquisition vs. those which use a “do it yourself” strategy and capture nutrients without relying strongly on mycorrhizae. We provide a framework, which predicts that the strength and direction of the biotic feedback between a pair of species is determined by the dissimilarity between them along each axis of the root economics space. We then use data from two case studies to show how to apply the framework, by analysing the response of plant-soil feedbacks to measures of distance and position along each axis and find some support for our predictions. Finally, we highlight further areas where our framework could be developed and propose study designs that would help to fill current research gaps.</p>

<h2> Climate dependency of Plant soil feedbacks </h2>
            
<p>Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) have been shown to be relevant drivers of forest community dynamics. However, few studies have explored variation of PSFs along environmental gradients. In a framework of climate change, there is a great need to understand how interactions between plants and soil microbes respond along climatic gradients. Therefore, we compared PSFs along a precipitation gradient in Mediterranean oak forests and included trait responses. Following the Stress Gradient Hypothesis (SGH), we expected less negative or even positive PSFs in the physically harsh dry end of our gradient and more negative PSFs in the wettest end. We grew Quercus ilex and Quercus suber acorns on soil inoculated with microbes sampled under adults of both species in six sites ranging in annual precipitation. After 4 months, we measured shoot biomass and allocation and morphological traits above and belowground. We found negative PSFs for Q. ilex independent of precipitation, whereas for Q. suber PSFs ranged from positive in dry sites to negative in wet sites, in agreement with the SGH. The leaf allocation showed patterns similar to shoot biomass, but belowground allocation and morphological traits revealed responses which could not be detected aboveground. We provide first evidence for context-dependent PSFs along a precipitation gradient. Moreover, we show that measuring root traits can help improve our understanding of climate-dependent PSFs. Such understanding helps to predict plant soil microbe interactions, and their role as drivers of plant community dynamics under ongoing climate change.</p>
